try to run the java code in topic 7 folder without fixing it

I have three Java files that are throwing runtime exceptions. Can you analyze each one and provide:
1. The root cause of each error
2. Why the error occurs
3. Where the error happens in the code
4. A specific fix for each file
5. Best practices to prevent similar errors

fix it for me and run the app

Create a simple hello world app in python
