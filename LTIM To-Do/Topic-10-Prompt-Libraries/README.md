# DEMO 10: Prompt Libraries - Reusable Patterns

## Learning Objective
Show how to create and use a library of proven prompts for common tasks

## Demo File Structure
Collection of reusable prompts organized by category

## Why Prompt Libraries Matter
- Consistent results across team
- No need to recreate prompts
- Team knowledge documented
- Quality improves with reuse
- Time saved every use

## Demo Steps

### Step 1: Show the Library (1 min)
1. Open `DEMO_10_prompt_library.md`
2. Show organization by category
3. Point out: Proven prompts, tested results

### Step 2: Use a Prompt (2 min)
1. Pick a prompt from the library (e.g., "Generate Tests")
2. Copy it into Copilot Chat
3. Customize for your code
4. Show the excellent results

### Step 3: Build Library (2 min)
1. Explain: "You can build this for your team"
2. Show: Prompt template structure
3. Discuss: How to document what works

### Step 4: Share Across Team (1 min)
1. Library in shared document
2. Team uses consistently
3. Results improve over time
4. Library grows with experience

## Total Time: 6 minutes (compress to 4 if needed)
